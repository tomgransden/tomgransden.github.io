# About me

I love all things app development and have specialised in React Native for the last 6 years. I'm lucky to have worked for some amazing companies, creating new React Native apps and also enhancing established ones.

I write quality, robust code backed up with tests and advocate for best practices.

I try to make a difference not only to the products I work on, but also to the people I work with. I do this by sharing knowledge and making myself available to support and upskill those around me.

## Education

### PhD in Computer Science

I was offered the chance to pursue a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Leicester between 2012 and 2017. I successfully defended my thesis - Automating Proofs with State Machine Inference which can be read [here](https://figshare.le.ac.uk/articles/thesis/Automating_Proofs_with_State_Machine_Inference/10204247?file=18393503)

### MComp in Computer Science (1st Class Honours)

I was lucky enough to obtain a 1st class MComp in Computer Science from the University of Leicester between 2008 and 2012. During this course I learned many fundamentals about software development such as advanced programming techniques, cryptography, testing and compression.

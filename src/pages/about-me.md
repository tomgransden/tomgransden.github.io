# About me

I love all things app development and have specialised in React Native for the last 6 years. I'm lucky to have worked for some amazing companies, creating new React Native apps and also enhancing established ones.

I write quality, robust code backed up with tests and advocate for best practices.

I try to make a difference not only to the products I work on, but also to the people I work with. I do this by sharing knowledge and making myself available to support and upskill those around me.
